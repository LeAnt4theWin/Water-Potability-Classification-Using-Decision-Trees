# Water-Potability-Classification-Using-Decision-Trees
In this project, I'll be using the water potability dataset (from kaggle) to predict water potability based on several physicochemical features. The goal is to classify water samples into two categories: potable (safe to drink) and not potable. Ill be using a Decision Tree Classifier and the KNN Classifier.
